Project Title:
Public Transit Simulator

Project Description:
A basic application using a GUI to allow the user to search for available trips using public transit in Stockholm.
The application displays a map of the centre of Stockholm with a number of destinations/places. 
The user chooses a place to travel from and a place to travel to and then presses "Search" to see the trip displayed. 
It displays all stops in between, the time it takes in minutes between each individual stop, and the total time of the trip. 
The user has the option to toggle between showing the quickest trip (using Dijkstra's algorithm) or the one with the least amount of stops (using Breadth First Search). 
There is also an "Options" menu in the upper left corner.
This menu allows the user to remove, add and change a current connection between two places. 
It also allows the user to then save the changes, and then to press "Open" to import the latest saved changes. 

Prerequisites and usage guide:
Make sure to have at least JDK version 13 installed. 
Install the JAVA IDE of your choice. 
Import/open the project folder.
